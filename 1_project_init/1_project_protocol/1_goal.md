# Goal

## Primary Goal

Build a clean, current PxFquery project that can reuse the valuable legacy assets to support controlled software development, reproducible analysis, and a pragmatic manuscript path.

## Scientific Goal

Position PxFquery as a LINCS-based perturbation-to-function bioinformatics workflow for interpreting drug- and gene-induced functional programs in biological contexts such as cancer cell lines.

## Functional Delivery Goal

PxFquery's project-level functional goal is not limited to static matrix lookup. A project-valid package must preserve the intended user-facing query experience:

- forward query: perturbation and biological context to functional response;
- reverse query: functional target and biological context to candidate perturbations;
- resolver-mediated natural-language or semi-structured query entry;
- exact, proxy, and not-found evidence routing for sparse biological coverage;
- LLM-assisted parsing and summarization through the current configured AI service when a milestone requires the user-facing resolver layer;
- deterministic fallback and transparent evidence metadata when LLM or proxy routing fails.

Milestones may stage these capabilities in layers, but a milestone may not silently redefine PxFquery as only deterministic dictionary or matrix lookup if the user-defined milestone requires resolver, LLM, proxy, or transfer behavior. Any proposed scope reduction, deferral, or optionalization of a functional capability must be explicitly reported to the user before task creation and must receive user approval.

## Manuscript Goal

Prepare for a realistic MDPI Genes-style submission by emphasizing a narrow, reproducible functional genomics workflow and a concrete biological case study, rather than presenting PxFquery as a broad AI-agent platform.

This manuscript path is graduation-oriented and journal-fit-oriented. The target is not to build a genuinely high-novelty tool paper or to compete with venues such as Bioinformatics, Nature-family journals, or other high-bar computational biology outlets. The work should look sufficiently substantial in the style of recent Genes papers while remaining practically lightweight, easy to understand, and close to article patterns that Genes has already accepted.

## Migration Goal

Use the T-001 semantic digestion outputs and the T-002 flat migrated asset library as the current bridge from legacy materials into new tasks. Future work should read migrated or registered assets first, then create new project outputs inside this repository.

## Near-Term Goals

1. Finish digestion-phase tasks until legacy assets, source authority, and project rules are clear enough for controlled development.
2. Define the minimal development and analysis work needed to produce manuscript-grade evidence.
3. Use the Genes literature survey to identify accepted paper patterns, workload presentation styles, and understandable result structures that PxFquery can realistically imitate.
4. Keep code, reports, figures, tables, and manuscript materials in the current project structure unless a task explicitly registers an external source.
5. Preserve provenance from legacy assets without reviving legacy directory structures as active protocol.
