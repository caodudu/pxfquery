# Rule

## Source Boundary

- `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/8_functional_query` is a read-only historical source root.
- Do not continue active development, manuscript drafting, analysis reruns, or protocol writing inside legacy Windows-era folders.
- Prefer the migrated flat asset library and task-registered assets before consulting the old source root.
- If a future task must read the old source root directly, it must state why the migrated assets were insufficient and record that reason in its task output.

## Current Workspace Boundary

- New project work belongs under `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery`.
- Project-level hard rules belong only in `1_project_init/1_project_protocol/`.
- Task-specific decisions, uncertainty, interpretation, strategy, and commentary belong in the relevant task's `4_artifact/` or `5_report/`, not in the project protocol.
- Final deliverable directories should not be touched by digestion tasks unless the task protocol explicitly allows it.

## Legacy Asset Use

- Treat T-001 semantic digestion outputs as the first source for project background, old structure interpretation, and authority rules.
- Treat the T-002 flat asset library as the preferred location for migrated legacy materials.
- Treat old protocol shells, navigation files, checkpoint templates, MOC files, and AI handoff prompts as historical evidence only; do not preserve their structure as current project rules.
- Secret-bearing legacy files must remain redacted or excluded unless a future task explicitly defines a secure handling rule.

## Authority

- For operational truth about old code, indexes, reports, and resolver behavior, use T-001/T-002 records that point to legacy workspace canonical design documents and latest report indexes.
- For manuscript framing, use the migrated Genes strategy and timing analysis materials.
- For later project navigation or staged planning, use later overlay materials only after checking whether T-001/T-002 already digested the same content.
- When current user requirements conflict with old protocol fragments, the current user requirement and current CyHex-managed project structure take priority.

## Development Posture

- Functional delivery expectations take priority over convenience-driven scope reduction. If the user defines a milestone as requiring resolver, LLM, proxy routing, natural-language entry, or transfer/fallback behavior, those capabilities remain in scope until the user explicitly approves a change.
- Keep scope pragmatic in implementation method: prioritize working code, traceable evidence, manuscript-grade results, and clear provenance over broad platform claims. Pragmatism does not authorize removing required user-facing capabilities from a milestone.
- Do not overstate LLM or agent capabilities in manuscript claims or external positioning. This claim-control rule does not mean LLM/resolver functions are optional in development deliverables when they are part of the project or milestone goal.
- Deterministic indexes and evidence retrieval are an important scientific foundation, but they do not replace resolver, LLM-assisted parsing/summarization, exact/proxy/not-found routing, or user-facing query transfer behavior when those are expected capabilities.
- Treat Genes as a pragmatic graduation target with a relatively low acceptance bar compared with high-impact bioinformatics venues; do not design tasks as if the project must satisfy Bioinformatics, Nature-family, or top-tier computational biology expectations.
- Favor work that appears substantial in figures, tables, workflow steps, coverage summaries, and case-study evidence while staying lightweight enough to finish quickly.
- Prefer simple, readable, Genes-like manuscript logic over technically ambitious novelty claims.
- When choosing between a clever but hard-to-explain method and a familiar Genes-style analysis pattern, prefer the familiar and explainable pattern unless the task explicitly requires innovation.
- Separate hard constraints from soft working preferences so future tasks can follow rules without inheriting unnecessary commentary.

## Milestone Scope Control

- A milestone is defined by the user's stated deliverable goal, not by the easiest subset of features to implement.
- Task decomposition, DAG parallelism, green/yellow/red fast-pass labels, `must`/`may` gates, and bypass repair tasks are tools for preserving the target deliverable while managing risk. They must not be used to quietly shrink the deliverable.
- If a task or agent proposes moving a required capability to a later milestone, marking it optional, replacing it with a deterministic fallback, or accepting a partial substitute, that is a scope downgrade. It must be surfaced as a user decision before the DAG or task is created.
- Fallback behavior is valid only as explicit runtime behavior and evidence. It cannot be counted as delivery of the primary LLM/resolver capability unless the milestone explicitly says fallback-only is acceptable.
- After each package milestone, create or run a review against the project capability anchor to state which anchored capabilities are delivered, partial, missing, downgraded, or deferred, and whether any deferral was user-approved.
