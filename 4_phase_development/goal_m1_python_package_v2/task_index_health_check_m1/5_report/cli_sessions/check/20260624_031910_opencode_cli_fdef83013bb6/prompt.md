# Checking Prompt
Generated: 2026-06-24 03:19

## 0. Role

You are the CyHex checking AI for one task.

Your job is to confirm whether the current configuration can be executed by a separate execution AI without wasting time, expanding scope, or guessing missing context.

You are not the configuration AI. You are not the execution AI. Do not redo predecessor discovery. Do not execute the task body. Do not produce final deliverables.

Your output is important because execution AI will read:

`/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1/5_report/handoff_check_before_exec.md`

Write it carefully. It should give execution strategy, risk controls, expected outputs, and stop conditions.

## 1. Assembled Context Snapshot

CyHex has already assembled the project protocol, project state, and current task configuration below. Use this snapshot as your default context.

Do not re-read these files in green_check. Open the source paths only if the snapshot is missing, truncated at the exact section you need, or internally contradictory.

You may still call `GET http://localhost:47291/api/version` once to confirm CyHex is running. You do not need to read `cyhex_protocol.md` unless this prompt is missing a checking rule you must apply.

Fallback path if the API response cannot be inspected but the local app is available:
- ~/.cyhex/app/protocols/cyhex_protocol.md

### 1.1 Project Protocol Snapshot

```text
# Overview

PxFquery is a macOS-hosted restart of a legacy bioinformatics project for LINCS-based perturbation-to-function analysis.

The project's active purpose is to turn useful legacy code, data, reports, and manuscript strategy into a controlled current workspace for later development and submission work. It is not a continuation of the old Windows-era directory trees.

Scientifically, PxFquery is a Python workflow/tool for querying drug- and gene-induced functional programs from perturbation data. Its core direction is:

- forward query: perturbation and biological context to functional response;
- reverse query: functional target and biological context to candidate perturbations;
- evidence-aware retrieval using exact and proxy matches;
- manuscript positioning around a concrete LINCS functional genomics use case rather than an inflated AI-agent platform claim.

The legacy project contains valuable material, including package code, query indexes, CMAP/LINCS-derived functional matrices, resolver reports, and Genes submission strategy. In the current project, those materials are treated as migrated or registered historical assets. Their useful meaning should be digested into current tasks before reuse.

The current project protocol is the persistent project-level rule layer. It should stay concise, current, and independent of old 4t, Obsidian, checkpoint, or Windows directory protocol shells.

```

### Project Protocol: 1_goal.md
Path: `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/1_project_init/1_project_protocol/1_goal.md`

```text
# Goal

## Primary Goal

Build a clean, current PxFquery project that can reuse the valuable legacy assets to support controlled software development, reproducible analysis, and a pragmatic manuscript path.

## Scientific Goal

Position PxFquery as a LINCS-based perturbation-to-function bioinformatics workflow for interpreting drug- and gene-induced functional programs in biological contexts such as cancer cell lines.

## Manuscript Goal

Prepare for a realistic MDPI Genes-style submission by emphasizing a narrow, reproducible functional genomics workflow and a concrete biological case study, rather than presenting PxFquery as a broad AI-agent platform.

This manuscript path is graduation-oriented and journal-fit-oriented. The target is not to build a genuinely high-novelty tool paper or to compete with venues such as Bioinformatics, Nature-family journals, or other high-bar computational biology outlets. The work should look sufficiently substantial in the style of recent Genes papers while remaining practically lightweight, easy to understand, and close to article patterns that Genes has already accepted.

## Migration Goal

Use the T-001 semantic digestion outputs and the T-002 flat migrated asset library as the current bridge from legacy materials into new tasks. Future work should read migrated or registered assets first, then create new project outputs inside this repository.

## Near-Term Goals

1. Finish digestion-phase tasks until legacy assets, source authority, and project rules are clear enough for controlled development.
2. Define the minimal development and analysis work needed to produce manuscript-grade evidence.
3. Use the Genes literature survey to identify accepted paper patterns, workload presentation styles, and understandable result structures that PxFquery can realistically imitate.
4. Keep code, reports, figures, tables, and manuscript materials in the current project structure unless a task explicitly registers an external source.
5. Preserve provenance from legacy assets without reviving legacy directory structures as active protocol.

### Project Protocol: 2_rule.md
Path: `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/1_project_init/1_project_protocol/2_rule.md`

```text
# Rule

## Source Boundary

- `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/8_functional_query` is a read-only historical source root.
- Do not continue active development, manuscript drafting, analysis reruns, or protocol writing inside legacy Windows-era folders.
- Prefer the migrated flat asset library and task-registered assets before consulting the old source root.
- If a future task must read the old source root directly, it must state why the migrated assets were insufficient and record that reason in its task output.

## Current Workspace Boundary

- New project work belongs under `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery`.
- Project-level hard rules belong only in `1_project_init/1_project_protocol/`.
- Task-specific decisions, uncertainty, interpretation, strategy, and commentary belong in the relevant task's `4_artifact/` or `5_report/`, not in the project protocol.
- Final deliverable directories should not be touched by digestion tasks unless the task protocol explicitly allows it.

## Legacy Asset Use

- Treat T-001 semantic digestion outputs as the first source for project background, old structure interpretation, and authority rules.
- Treat the T-002 flat asset library as the preferred location for migrated legacy materials.
- Treat old protocol shells, navigation files, checkpoint templates, MOC files, and AI handoff prompts as historical evidence only; do not preserve their structure as current project rules.
- Secret-bearing legacy files must remain redacted or excluded unless a future task explicitly defines a secure handling rule.

## Authority

- For operational truth about old code, indexes, reports, and resolver behavior, use T-001/T-002 records that point to legacy workspace canonical design documents and latest report indexes.
- For manuscript framing, use the migrated Genes strategy and timing analysis materials.
- For later project navigation or staged planning, use later overlay materials only after checking whether T-001/T-002 already digested the same content.
- When current user requirements conflict with old protocol fragments, the current user requirement and current CyHex-managed project structure take priority.

## Development Posture

- Keep scope pragmatic: prioritize working code, traceable evidence, manuscript-grade results, and clear provenance over broad platform claims.
- Do not overstate LLM or agent capabilities; deterministic indexes and evidence retrieval are the safer manuscript foundation.
- Treat Genes as a pragmatic graduation target with a relatively low acceptance bar compared with high-impact bioinformatics venues; do not design tasks as if the project must satisfy Bioinformatics, Nature-family, or top-tier computational biology expectations.
- Favor work that appears substantial in figures, tables, workflow steps, coverage summaries, and case-study evidence while staying lightweight enough to finish quickly.
- Prefer simple, readable, Genes-like manuscript logic over technically ambitious novelty claims.
- When choosing between a clever but hard-to-explain method and a familiar Genes-style analysis pattern, prefer the familiar and explainable pattern unless the task explicitly requires innovation.
- Separate hard constraints from soft working preferences so future tasks can follow rules without inheriting unnecessary commentary.

Path: `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/1_project_init/1_project_protocol/3_environment.md`

# Environment

## Active Paths

- Project root: `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery`
- Project protocol: `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/1_project_init/1_project_protocol`
- Migrated legacy asset library: `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/2_project_asset/1_raw_material/legacy_flat_asset_library_v20260614`
- Historical source root: `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/8_functional_query`

## Runtime Context

- Primary operating system: macOS.
- Project orchestration: CyHex local app and CyHex task structure.
- Historical code context: Python package/workflow for PxFquery, including perturbation data loading, query indexes, forward/reverse query logic, resolver logic, and LLM-assisted natural-language interpretation.

## Python Runtime

- Default Python environment: `/Users/dudu/Softwares/miniconda/envs/pxfquery`.
- Default command style: `/Users/dudu/Softwares/miniconda/bin/conda run -n pxfquery python ...`.
- Use this environment for PxFquery code execution, data analysis, crawling scripts, statistics scripts, LLM/API helper scripts, and manuscript-supporting analysis unless a task explicitly documents why another runtime is required.
- Do not use the base conda environment for project execution except for environment inspection or conda management.
- If a required Python package is missing, a task may install it into the `pxfquery` environment when the package is necessary for that task; the task output should record the package name, install command, and reason.

## Data And Asset Context

- Core historical data include CMAP/LINCS AD perturbation matrices, functional score matrices, compound metadata, cell line metadata, gene metadata, gene sets, query indexes, reports, and manuscript strategy files.
- Large or binary assets should be treated as registered raw materials, not as text context to load casually.
- Current tasks should read only the assets needed for their protocol step and should preserve provenance for reused materials.

## Source Authority

- T-001 digestion outputs define the current interpretation of legacy background, structure, and source priority.
- T-002 migration outputs define which assets were migrated, redacted, or intentionally not migrated.
- The flat asset library is the preferred readable source for migrated legacy content.
- Direct legacy-root reads are exceptional and must be justified by task output.

## Language And Documentation

- Local project explanations may be written in Chinese when that improves maintainability.
- Code package names, filenames, technical identifiers, and manuscript-facing labels may remain in English.
- Persistent project protocol should remain concise and avoid embedding CyHex system internals or old legacy protocol mechanics.

# Current State — PxFquery

Updated: 2026-06-22

## Project Status

PxFquery is an active CyHex project migrated from legacy functional-query materials. The project is in development, with current focus on `4_phase_development/goal_algorithm_function_review/task_mvp_algorithm_run-through_review`.

The project currently has no final external deliverable registered in `6_project_deliverable/`. Existing outputs are task-level digestion, review, evidence, and preparation artifacts under each task's `4_artifact/`.

## Active Tasks Needing Human Review Or Continuation

- T-012 `task_genes_bioinformatics_deliverable_catalog`: delivered catalogs/supplements and remains active pending acceptance.
- T-013 `task_mvp_algorithm_run-through_review`: delivered MVP review evidence and remains active pending acceptance or follow-up decision.
- T-014 `task_understand_pxfquery_precomputed_data`: delivered precomputed-data understanding package and remains active pending acceptance.
- T-015 `task_mdpi_submission_package_and_guide`: delivered submission-rule package and remains active pending acceptance.

## Current Rules

- Use CyHex naming for current project governance. Historical Cyber wording in old files is legacy context only.
- Do not modify legacy source roots directly. Prefer migrated assets and task-registered sources.
- Do not treat task-level reports as final project deliverables until a future task explicitly promotes them into `6_project_deliverable/` and registers them.

## CyHex 1.0.23 Task Graph Backfill

Updated: 2026-06-22

Task dependency and artifact lineage edges were backfilled into `1_project_init/2_task_registration/task_graph.yaml` from existing asset registrations, artifact registries, and completion reports. This records current task references only; it does not change task status, task outputs, or delivered artifacts.

## 2. Task

Project: PxFquery (P-012)
Project phase/status: development / active
Task phase: development
Task ID: T-045 | Name: index_health_check_m1
Status: active | Executor: hybrid
Objective: Check the health of M1-relevant indexes before any real loader hardening. Use T-021 standard-resource outputs to verify index schema, readability, required keys, missing fields, and known gaps for forward/reverse demos. Deliver an index health report and machine-readable check summary. This task must not rebuild or overwrite authoritative indexes; it may only report minimal patch recommendations.
Notes / User Natural-Language Intent: Constraint supplement for config AI: This is an audit/check asset, not a rebuild task. Verify only M1-relevant index schema, readability, required keys, and gaps from T-021. Do not overwrite or regenerate authoritative indexes. Deliver machine-readable health summary plus human-readable gap notes. This task supports T-047 hardening and should not block the fixture-only M1 path.
Task path: /Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1

## 3. Hard Scope Boundary

Allowed reads by default:
- CyHex protocol.
- Project protocol/state listed above.
- Current task files listed above.
- Registered local asset paths only if the preflight summary or protocol quality check requires content inspection.

Selected predecessor artifacts are allowed only through the current task's `1_asset/registration.yaml`.

Do not scan arbitrary predecessor task folders.
Do not browse unrelated task material.
Do not scan `2_project_asset/` unless this task phase is digestion.
If this is development/translation and a needed input only exists in `2_project_asset/`, stop and require a predecessor digestion task or corrected registration.
Do not read future-stage prompts from `2_protocol/0_prompt/`:
- Do not read `*_action_prompt.md`
- Do not read `*_delivery_prompt.md`
- Do not read any prompt for a stage after checking

## 4. Backend Asset Preflight

CyHex has already performed mechanical asset checks before generating this prompt.

Do not repeat `ls`/full-path scanning for every registered asset when this summary is clean. Use the summary first.

```yaml
asset_preflight:
  registration_path: /Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1/1_asset/registration.yaml
  asset_rule_path: /Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1/2_protocol/3_asset_rule/asset_rule.yaml
  task_phase: development
  project_asset_access: forbidden
  zero_assets: true
  total_assets: 0
  symlink_sync:
    checked: 0
    linked: 0
    skipped: 0
    changed: false
  counts:
    ok: 0
    planned: 0
    remote: 0
    missing: 0
    empty_file: 0
    empty_dir: 0
    forbidden_scope: 0
  assets:
  - none
```

Interpretation:
- `ok`: no deeper asset-path inspection needed by default.
- `planned`: acceptable only if protocol explicitly says execution will acquire/search it.
- `remote`: acceptable only if execution has tool/network ability and protocol names the acquisition method.
- `missing`, `empty_file`, `empty_dir`, `forbidden_scope`: anomaly. Enter Yellow repair or Red block.
- `zero_assets: true`: acceptable only for a no-input task, a pure code/UI task based on current repo, or a task whose protocol explicitly starts with permitted web/search acquisition. Otherwise block or repair.

## 5. Default Mode: Green Check

Start in Green Check mode.

In Green Check:
1. Read required files.
2. Trust clean mechanical asset preflight unless protocol/registry text contradicts it.
3. Do not inspect every asset content.
4. Check whether the configuration is executable.
5. Write `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1/5_report/handoff_check_before_exec.md`.
6. Stop after the check report. Do not call any `/prompt/generate*` endpoint.

## 6. Yellow Repair

Enter Yellow Repair when the configuration is close but flawed.

Allowed repairs:
- PATCH task status to active if needed.
- Fix wrong/missing asset path entries in `1_asset/registration.yaml`.
- Fix `2_protocol/3_asset_rule/asset_rule.yaml` if required/forbidden/output rules are inconsistent.
- Revise `2_protocol/2_protocol_split/protocol.md` if steps/deliverables are vague, oversized, or disconnected from selected assets.
- Create/update expected `3_execution/` step folders if protocol requires them.
- Write `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1/5_report/handoff_check_before_exec.md`.
- Do not generate downstream prompts. CyHex backend will generate the execution prompt only after check approval.

When repairing an asset anomaly, inspect only the specific selected predecessor artifact registry/handoff/report needed to correct the path. Do not scan whole predecessor folders.

## 7. Red Block

Enter Red Block when execution would waste time or fake success.

Block if:
- A required local asset is missing/empty and cannot be repaired from selected records.
- A development/translation task requires raw `2_project_asset/` access.
- `zero_assets: true` but the task clearly needs input assets and no permitted acquisition step exists.
- Protocol lacks concrete steps or deliverables and cannot be repaired from current information.
- The task needs a capability not available to execution AI.
- The current protocol, asset registry, and asset rules cannot be made mutually consistent.

In Red Block:
- Do not execute the task.
- Do not write deliverables.
- Write `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1/5_report/blocked.md` with exact blocker, evidence, and required fix.
- Do not claim checking passed.

## 8. Execution Plan Quality Gate

The plan is passable only if:
1. It has about 4-8 concrete execution steps unless the task is genuinely tiny.
2. Each step names an operation, input, and expected intermediate or final output.
3. It includes a conservative first move: smoke test, demo subset, dry run, small sample, or UI sanity check where applicable.
4. It considers compute/time/network/API cost.
5. It defines stop conditions before expensive or destructive operations.
6. Deliverables are concrete: expected file type, likely path, and acceptance signal.
7. It does not ask execution AI to rediscover all predecessor context.
8. It does not allow final reusable outputs to remain only in `3_execution/`.

If these are not true, repair protocol and handoff before passing.

## 9. Required handoff_check_before_exec.md Shape

Write `/Users/dudu/Documents/3_Project/12_PxFquery/4_phase_development/goal_m1_python_package_v2/task_index_health_check_m1/5_report/handoff_check_before_exec.md` in this exact structure:

```md
# Check Handoff Before Exec: T-045 index_health_check_m1
